## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone or Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd "Wind Energy Forcaster"
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Create virtual environment named "wind"
python -m venv wind

# Activate the virtual environment
.\wind\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If you get an execution policy error, run this first:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
# Create virtual environment named "wind"
python -m venv wind

# Activate the virtual environment
wind\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment named "wind"
python3 -m venv wind

# Activate the virtual environment
source wind/bin/activate
```

**Note**: After activation, you should see `(wind)` at the beginning of your command prompt. Always activate the virtual environment before working on the project.

### 3. Run Setup Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Create directories manually or use Git Bash to run setup.sh
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated before installing dependencies.

### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow, xgboost, lightgbm, prophet, streamlit; print('All packages installed successfully!')"
```

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Data Processing

Process and prepare the data:

```bash
python src/main.py --mode process
```

This will:
- Load and validate the data
- Create features (lag, rolling, seasonal)
- Save processed data to `data/processed/`

### 2. Train Models

Train all models:

```bash
python src/train.py --model all
```

Train a specific model:

```bash
python src/train.py --model LSTM
python src/train.py --model Transformer
python src/train.py --model XGBoost
python src/train.py --model LightGBM
python src/train.py --model Prophet
```

### 3. Make Predictions

Generate predictions with a trained model:

```bash
python src/predict.py --model LSTM --n_days 30
```

### 4. Launch Dashboard

Start the interactive dashboard:

**Important**: Always use `python -m streamlit` to ensure it uses your virtual environment:

```bash
python -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

**Note**: Use `python -m streamlit` instead of just `streamlit` to ensure it uses the correct Python environment. The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
